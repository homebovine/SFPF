These codes aim to reproduce the results presented in the Section 5.2. 

If you need to check the results in Section 5.1, you can use Setting2_normal.py, with setting n=10,20 and 30.

Setting1_normal.py to Setting4_normal.py: four different settings in Section 5.2 with normal errors.
Setting1_t.py to Setting4_t.py: four different settings in Section 5.2 with t(3) errors.

Ensure that Python and R are installed on your system. You need to load necessary libraries before running the codes.

We also include the codes in folder SFPF_oracle, to reproduce the results under the oracle scenario where we know the subgroup membership and directly estimate the model without penalization term.
